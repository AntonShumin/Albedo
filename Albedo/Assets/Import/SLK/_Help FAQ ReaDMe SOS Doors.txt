Hi 

First! Thanks to bought the kit :) Really!

I hope it will give you satisfaction. But please, no matter the opinion you have 
(i prefried good, but i play the game), please take 5 minutes of your time to leave a 
review and put the stars that seem right to you... That really help us.

But pity not to use the review as weir anger or to request support. For that use :

Why ? Just because we check our mails more than the unity store reviews...

"Those damned doors did not open? Why?"
---------------------------------------

- Keep calm :) Do not write a crappy review now :) You just have to put the door game objects 
  to static = off, to play with the doors during runtime (do not forget to re-check it for lightmap
  it's the pain in the ass of this method i guess, check/uncheck all the time the static objects.
  I can not tell you the number of times, after two hours of lightmap, i realized that the doors were
  in static = off...)
